I'll provide a comprehensive testing guide to verify the functionality of your full-stack Loan Management System. Let's break this down by features and the testing flow:

1. **Initial Setup Verification**
```bash
# Start the services in separate terminals:

# Terminal 1 - Start .NET Backend
cd DotNet/LoanManagementSystem
dotnet run

# Terminal 2 - Start Node.js Loan Service
cd NodeJS/loan-service
npm start

# Terminal 3 - Start React Frontend
cd ReactJS/loan-management-client
npm start
```

2. **User Authentication Testing**

# Get User's Loans
curl http://localhost:3001/api/loans/user/loans -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

7. **Database Verification**
```bash
# Check SQLite Database
# The database file should be at: NodeJS/loan-service/database.sqlite
# You can use SQLite Browser or command line:
sqlite3 NodeJS/loan-service/database.sqlite

# View tables
.tables

# Check loan applications
SELECT * FROM loans;

# Check payments

    2. Applies for a loan
    3. Loan Officer approves the loan
    4. Borrower makes payments
    5. Loan is marked as completed

    Scenario 2: Loan Rejection
    1. Borrower applies for a loan
    2. Loan Officer reviews and rejects
    3. Borrower receives rejection notification
    4. Status updates in My Loans

    Scenario 3: Payment Processing
    1. Find an approved loan
    2. Make monthly payment
    3. Verify payment record
    4. Check loan balance update
    ```

**Expected Results:**
- All services should start without errors
- Database connections should be established
- User registration and login should work seamlessly
- Loan applications should flow through all statuses correctly
- Payments should be processed and recorded accurately
- All role-based permissions should work as expected
- Error messages should be clear and helpful

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
1. Check console logs in all three terminals for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Confirm database file exists and has proper permissions
4. Check network requests in browser developer tools
5. Verify JWT tokens in local storage
6. Check CORS settings if API calls fail
